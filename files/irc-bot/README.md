## What does OpenMRS IRC bot do?

### Aliases:

Aliases are commands used to interact with OpenMRSBot.        Some commands take arguments.        Arguments are documented with symbols $1 $2 $3 etc. for arguments 1, 2, 3, etc.        Users can invoke a command in the IRC channel with the `!` symbol.        Example (use the google alias to return a url to the google search for keyword openmrs): `!google openmrs`

- hi: action offers this IRC tip: Rather than just saying Hi at people, it's more effective (and less rude) if you just ask your question in the channel. That way the person you want (or others) can answer as soon as they see your question, rather than waiting on you to look at your screen again. :-)
- scrumoff: action says the DAILY SCRUM MEETING has ENDED. This channel is now returned to normal hacking operations. Post-scrum meeting follow-up conversations may now begin.
